I'm Sreedev, a driven professional passionate about data, with 9 years of experience in the software industry, building 25+ Android apps and delivering 50+ features. I hold a postgraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from Loyalist College, Toronto, and my portfolio showcases 3 passion projects on data engineering. I am a dedicated team player with experience managing teams of up to 12 members across industries such as banking and healthcare.

My strong coding and people management skills make me a great fit for any team. My achievements include a 6500+ reputation on Stack Overflow, certifications in Azure, Java, Python, and SQL, and winning a hackathon at Nihilent. My experience as a research and data analyst at the Ministry of the Solicitor General of Ontario allowed me to learn how data can be used to solve real-world problems. I create solutions that are maintainable, sustainable, and cost-effective. As I am transforming my career from mobile apps to data, I am eager to leverage my skills in data engineering. I aim to contribute to transformative projects in technology.
